## ✍️ Description & Execution
### Leader
- 123 - [Enchufla](/moves/enchufla) start but left down right up
  - She does [Settenta](/moves/settenta) spin but anti-clockwise
  - She should do around 180°, you meet her on the other side because of [Enchufla](/moves/enchufla)
- 567 - [Runde](/moves/runde) for me
  - I signal her to do a [Vuelta](/moves/vuelta) while doing my [Runde](/moves/runde)
  - Palm up, don't hold (it won't work), *catch* hand on the way down
- 123 - Walk in this position
- 5 - Keep pulling her, but I kind of stop
- 67 - Sharp [Espejo](/moves/espejo)
- End with [Enchufla](/moves/enchufla) [Runde](/moves/runde)
---
- This is the core of the move, when called it might consider doing a [Settenta](/moves/settenta) and then during after the [Enchufla](/moves/enchufla) you go into this
