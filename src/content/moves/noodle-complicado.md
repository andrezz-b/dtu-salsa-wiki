## ✍️ Description & Execution
### Leader
- Start from [Dile Que No Position](/concepts/dile-que-no-position)
- 123 - [Dile Que No](/moves/dile-que-no)
- 567 - Open up, you should be looking inside the circle
  - There should be space in front of me so the follower can walk
- 1 - Make her step back
- 23 - Pull forward, prepare hands for [Vuelta](/moves/vuelta)
- 567 - Do [Vuelta](/moves/vuelta) on the go (she keeps walking)
  - For smoothens turn with one hand after the other (don't lift them too high)
  - 7 - I start going forward
  - My right hand goes over my head (like [Corona Finish](/concepts/corona-finish))
- 123 - Cross forwards and *unroll* from the right hand
- 4/5 - [Gancho](/concepts/gancho) with the left hand
  - This is optional but looks nice
- 567 - Cross behind
  - 7 - Right hand on her head ([Corona Finish](/concepts/corona-finish) for her)
  - Keep the [Gancho](/concepts/gancho) until 1
- 123 567 - [Sacala](/moves/sacala)
  - You should end up again with your right hand on your right shoulder ([Corona Finish](/concepts/corona-finish) for me) - like before
- 123 567 - Do the whole cross, [Gancho](/concepts/gancho) and [Corona Finish](/concepts/corona-finish) for her
  - You can keep doing this more times or exit
- 123 - Exit with [Dile Que No](/moves/dile-que-no)
  - Hand still around her head
- 567 - [Coca-Cola](/moves/coca-cola)
  - Let go of the hand around her head at the last moment
### Follower

## ✨ Variations
### From Sacala
- 123 567 - Do a normal [Sacala](/moves/sacala) (Can be with left or right hand)
  - 7 - Ask for the other hand
    - If you did the move with the right hand you will have to switch
- 123 567 - Do the [Sacala](/moves/sacala) with both hands
- You end up in the position ([Corona Finish](/concepts/corona-finish) for me) to do the rest of the move 
### On Spot (Unsure ?)
- 123 567 - [Vuelta](/moves/vuelta) on spot
- 123 - I do 180° and roll in (Right hand on my right shoulder)
- 567 - Continue turn towards follower
  - 5 - With [Gancho](/concepts/gancho)
- 123 - Micro basic
- 567 - [Sacala](/moves/sacala) / [Vuelta](/moves/vuelta)
- TODO: Exit somewhere with [Enchufla](/moves/enchufla)
