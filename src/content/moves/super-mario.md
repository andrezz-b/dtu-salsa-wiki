## ✍️ Description & Execution
### Leader
- 123 567 123 - [Setenta Complicado](/moves/setenta-complicado)
  - My hand should go down at the end, not stay up in front of her face
  - There should be some hand adjustment during the last 123 for this to work
- 567 - [Ronde](/moves/ronde) with hands down
- 123 - I go under, keep pulling her
- 567 - Keep pulling into [Corona Finish](/concepts/corona-finish) for me
- 8 - Start lift both hands up
  - Early is better to have time
- 12 - Hands should peak, and should start putting them down
  - Do not walk much to keep close
  - She should turn, you are back to back
- 3 - The hands go down
  - During the hand going down process switch left hand to palm up hold (**VERY HARD**)
- 567 - Lift left over your head
  - You are in [Hammerlock](/concepts/hammerlock)
- 123 - [Enchufla](/moves/enchufla)
- 567 - Hand on shoulder [Ronde](/moves/ronde) into finish
---
- The hardest part is the hands going up and left hand transition - good way to practice that part is [Setenta y Uno](/moves/setenta-y-uno) as it ends in [Corona Finish](/concepts/corona-finish)
