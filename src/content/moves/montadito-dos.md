## ✍️ Description & Execution
### Leader
- Do [Montadito](/moves/montadito)
- 567 - When you are finishing the arms stuff, on 67 drop them both back (her left on my left side and her right on my right side)
  - I catch them and we are in a [Cubanito](/moves/cubanito) like position
- 123 - Start [Setenta](/moves/setenta) from this reversed position
  - My left arm goes on my back, as far as it can go to the side
- 567 - She turns in and we are side to side
  - Very weird position you must be close
- 123 - Walk in this position
- 567 - Unroll, I go under my right hand, we are now in [Hammerlock](/concepts/hammerlock)
  - Hand on her back maybe needs to change hold because it's weird
- 123 - [Enchufla](/moves/enchufla)
- 567 - [Sombrero Finish](/concepts/sombrero-finish) or [Alternative Sombrero Finish](/moves/alternative-sombrero-finish)
