## ✍️ Description & Execution
- This is a [Role Switch](/concepts/role-switch) move
- Counting will be done as normal, this may cause the counting to shift by 4 counts after a role switch
### Leader
- Get into [Dile Que No Position](/concepts/dile-que-no-position)
- 123 - Start [Sacala](/moves/sacala)
- 567 - Don't step back but forward, and do half [Espejo](/moves/espejo) (left turn 180°) under the hand
- 123 - You are now the *follower*
  - The *leader* should pull you to their side and go from there
  - If they do not start leading (pulling), abandon and go to [Enchufla](/moves/enchufla)
### Follower
- 123 - Leader starts [Sacala](/moves/sacala)
- 567 - Normally finish [Sacala](/moves/sacala), notice that leader goes forwards
- 123 - You are now the *leader*
  - You have the *followers* right hand
  - Pull the *follower* to your side
  - 3 - Right hand on *followers* shoulder
---
- This can be looped as you end in [Dile Que No Position](/concepts/dile-que-no-position)
  - A funny combo is to do 2 switches (follower cooperates) into [Noodle Complicado](/moves/noodle-complicado)
