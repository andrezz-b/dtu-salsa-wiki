## ✍️ Description & Execution
### Leader
- From [Crossed Hands](/concepts/crossed-hands)
- 5 - Step right, 90°

  - Right hand behind my head
  - You pull her (similar to 567 after [Enchufla](/moves/enchufla), you want her on the side)
- 67 - Turn back forwards and left above my head
  - 6 - Let go of the right hand
  - Turn should be sharp
